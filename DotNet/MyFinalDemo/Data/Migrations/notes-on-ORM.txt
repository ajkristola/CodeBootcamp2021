Notes:

EF is an Object Relation Mapper (ORM). It takes the class properties (fields?)
and creates table entries representing them. Database is updated using migrations. 
Pros: No SQL, quick, works for basic applications.

Optionally, create Data Access Object (DAO) for manual table creation 
and querying in SQL. 
Pros: more visibility in finding problems, preferred in large applications.

To use: 

1. <add-migration "name"> in PM console
2. Computer creates "name" file in Migrations with code to create tables.
3. <update-database> in PM console
4. ORM creates tables, in this case for 
(a) user accounts, logins etc.
(b) memo questions and answers. 
5.
